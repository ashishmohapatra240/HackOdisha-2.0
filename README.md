# Nirbhaya

The problem Nirbhaya solves is the safety and security of women. In India, safety and security for women have been a concern for centuries now. Most of them are in rural areas, so seeking aid and support when in a crisis has been a far-fetched solution for these women. As India races towards becoming an economic superpower, the country is lacking in women's safety- with an alarming number of women succumbing to abuse and harassment.

For this I developed "Nirbhaya"-Ban Nidar, Ban Nirbhaya!

## App Features
Monitor the user's position after a specified time (Set by the user)
Shake your phone to transmit SOS alerts even if the app is closed!
Contact the local police station, hospital, and bus stops
Find emergency contact numbers and dial directly from the app

## Future Prospects:
Calculate the best route by rating the roads using different parameters
Save Audio and Video with the shake, which will allow the user's device audio to be recorded so that it can be used as evidence by the police department

## Challenges I ran into

I used Flutter to create this app. Flutter comes with various packages, and I required packages that were 2-3 years old, which caused many issues such as depreciated APIs and no sound null safety. I tried a variety of alternatives and hacks to get the same outcome. An SOS app should be based on an extensive UX study, which is why I interviewed many of my female friends before designing the app. In addition, I intend to build on this concept and create a fully functional app that all women may access. I'll begin by having my friends install this app.
